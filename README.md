<H2>Built With:</H2>
It is built with the PyQt frameword for Python & PySide2 under the Open-Source Licenses.
<br>
The fundamental core & all its functions were adapted from the original Command Prompt version. The GUI version improves in many of the things than its CMD 
counterpart.

<H2>Version History & Improvements:</H2>

<H3>Version 1.0</H3>
This version was the early Alpha built that was work-in-progress & introduced the GUI Login Screen. (Note: Nothing Worked Properly.)

<H3>Version 1.1</H3>
This introduced many functions & used a text file to store the hash of the masterpassword.

<H3>Version 1.2</H3>
This introduced more functionality & security in the way the masterpassword was stored. <br>
This included the use of multi-checking / cross checking of files to make sure that the vault was secure & prevented unauthorised access.
If suspected of unauthorised access, the program would tell the user to reset everything & will do the same evey time the program restarts until done so.
